This Repo will house all the projects i have worked on and had access to clone. the files uploaded will be in .zip type and inside should include the datasets used and the notebooks with the code. 
If available will also contain reports, assuming they're not big in size.

To run and replicate my results, the zip file should be obtained and run throu jupyter notebook or another Python compiler. I believe the python version was 3.10.10 but may run in some older versions.
If the datasets wouldn't load into the project, please correct the loading code to fit the location of downloaded files now in your workspace.
